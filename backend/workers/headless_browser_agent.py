"""Headless browser agent for automated faucet interactions.

This module encapsulates the logic required to interact with faucets
using a headless browser.  Many modern faucets rely on complex
JavaScript, anti‑bot techniques and CAPTCHAs that cannot be handled
through simple HTTP requests alone.  By leveraging a headless
browser (such as Playwright or Puppeteer) you can automate clicks,
form submissions and other dynamic interactions.

Due to the constraints of the current environment this implementation
provides a thin wrapper around Playwright.  If Playwright is not
installed, calls to this module will raise ImportError.  To enable
headless mode, install Playwright in your deployment environment and
run ``playwright install`` to download the browser binaries.

Example::

    from .headless_browser_agent import HeadlessBrowserAgent
    agent = HeadlessBrowserAgent()
    result = agent.claim("https://examplefaucet.com", wallet="0x1234", api_key="abc")
    agent.close()

The ``claim`` method should be extended to perform whatever steps are
necessary on a given site (login, solve captcha via external solver,
submit wallet address, etc.).  Currently it performs a simple page
load and returns a stubbed success.  You should customise this
function per faucet or implement site detection logic.

            The URL of the faucet page.
        wallet : str
            The wallet address to claim to.

        -----
        This implementation is intentionally minimal.  It navigates to
        the given URL, waits briefly and returns a stubbed success.  You
        must customise this function based on the structure of each
        faucet.  For example you may need to wait for a button with a
        known selector, click it, fill in the wallet address and
        optionally handle CAPTCHAs via an external solver.  See
        Playwright documentation for guidance.
