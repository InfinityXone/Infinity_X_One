"""
Guardian Worker
===============

This script is invoked by the gateway whenever a directive is sent to
the ``guardian`` agent.  In this simplified example it logs the
received prompt and writes a heartbeat entry to ``./logs/guardian.log``.
In a production deployment this worker would enforce security
policies, perform integrity checks and potentially halt unsafe
operations.
